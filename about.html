      <h1 class="slide-in from-bottom">COMPANY OVERVIEW</h1>
      <p class="slide-in from-bottom">As a private research organization which focuses on garnering support towards the ultimate
        humanitarian mission of space colonization, Galactic Academy has been always focusing on domesticating space towards every
        single person of the world. Galactic Academy consists of members from all over the Earth, as our organization is based on
        the peoples’ contribution towards a crucial and significant mission of extraterrestrial travel. We believe that with the
        support of more individuals towards the construction of private space companies to execute interstellar missions towards foreign
        celestial bodies, humanity will be able to salvage itself from the inevitable crisis of overpopulation, natural resource depletions,
        and unsustainable energy. </p>

        <p class="slide-in from-bottom">Galactic Academy was founded by CEO Kenzo Eugenio Tjandra under the impression of these humanitarian
          crises, implying an objective to innovate aerospace engineering as efficiently as possible. Space exploration and colonization
          unequivocally consumes a multifarious amount of resources and energy, where it is also undoubtedly time consuming to achieve
          successful missions which will revolutionize the aeronautical progress of a multiplanetary civilization as a whole. We investigated
          that funding for space exploration has declined by the government, while private space companies are the new assets for space
          exploration. However, most individuals are mainly lacking the courage to invest in such agencies, which will irrevocably determine
          the future of space exploration and its entirety. By exposing the importance and significance of these efforts of aerospace engineering
          towards the fate of humanity, we urge to restore the courage of our audiences to secure the mission of colonizing outer space. </p>

        <p class="slide-in from-left">Our purpose as an advocacy and scientific organization is to highlight the importance of
          space exploration for humanity’s imminent future, where natural problems might be the eventual demise of the human
          race. We want to enact ourselves as an advisor for many people both within the general and scientific community,
          where our mission is to implement the courage to invest in long term space exploration missions. Every single person
          within the planet possesses the ability to support our cause, where it is our goal to eliminate the sense of doubt
          towards the scientific development in aeronautics.</p>
