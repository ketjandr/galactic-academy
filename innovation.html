        <p class="slide-in from-bottom">The space race within the 1900’s signifies the beginning to a space age which was
          reliant on aerospace and aeronautical sciences, where innovation and revolutionary discoveries are profound after
          humanity had harnessed nuclear energy. Space technologies are soon continuously constructed, marking the space war
          and cultural developments between the United States and the former Soviet Union. The space age and its technological
          advancements still continue to date, where humans are cooperating to conduct observational research on extraterrestrial
          celestial objects as well as discovering habitable zones within the solar system to find settlement and decrease the
          probability of human extinction.</p>

        <p class="slide-in from-right">Space-X, a private aerospace company, had successfully launched their 100th
          extraterrestrial flight in October 2020. The Starlink Mission managed to launch 60 Space-X satellites
          into the orbital zone of planet Earth from the Space Launch Complex 40 located at Cape Canaveral, Florida.
          This remarkable launch represented how powerful the Falcon-9 rocket is, able to launch a number of satellites
          at once.</p>

          <h1 class="slide-in from-right">THE LAUNCH OF SPUTNIK-1</h1>
          <p class="slide-in from-right">The Soviet Union inaugurated the first artificial satellite which bewildered the world, implementing
            revolutionary technology as well as declaring a space-exploration monopoly against the United States.
            Sputnik-1, the alias of the artificial satellite, was derived from a connotation implying a travel
            companion, signifying how it will be the apex of extraterrestrial travel. Sputnik-1 was launched into
            an elliptical orbit around the Earth travelling approximately 29,000 kilometers per hour utilizing the
            componential structure of the R-7 Semyorka ICBM, materializing nuclear energy as a thruster to propel
            it outwards overcoming the tenacious force of gravity.</p>
          <p class="slide-in from-right">Sputnik-1 possessed a distinctive spherical contour with a diameter of 58.5 centimeters, weighing at
            83.6 kilograms. This meant that the satellite was about the size of a beachball yet it had the weight
            of an average adult male. The outer membrane of the sphere was shielded and polished with a 1-millimeter
            aluminum-alloy coating as a heat insulator. Four separate whip-like antennae each measuring 240 centimeters
            extend from the satellite’s outer body, as they are constructed to transmit radio signals from its orbital
            zone to Earth.</p>

          <p class="slide-in from-right">The United States launched their first artificial satellite, Explorer-1, following the launch of Sputnik-1
            in 1957. The satellite was designed by Dr. Wernher von Braun, where the Jet Propulsion Library remarked this
            technological innovation as an instrument to revolutionize space exploration. Its orbit was 354 kilometers
            relative to the Earth’s surface, where it would travel up to 25,150 kilometers an hour. The satellite on its
            own was coated with aluminum alloys, where it weighed approximately 14 kilograms. Explorer-1 not only enacted
            as the first artificial satellite and instrument launched by the United States, however also allowed for the
            measurement of strong radiation from a belt of charged particles trapped in space by Earth's magnetic field. </p>

          <p class="slide-in from-right">The National Aeronautics and Space Administration was created in the United States as a governmental agency
            held by the federal government to ultimately aid the innovation of space technology as the country is approaching
            a space race. NASA’s establishment succeeded the former governmental space agency known as National Advisory
            Committee for Aeronautics, reinforcing the military industrial complex which is prominently uplifted by former
            US president Dwight D. Eisenhower. The government’s contribution towards space exploration allowed for an aggressive
            advancement in aeronautics research fundings and investments, exponentially boosting the industry of aerospace engineering. </p>

          <p class="slide-in from-right">Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gargarin became the first man in the vacuum of outer space aboarding the Vostok-1 spacecraft.
            Gargarin himself was 27 years old during the manned mission, where he was a test-pilot and industrial technician
             working for the Soviet governmental agency. Vostok-1 managed to completely orbit the Earth for up to 89 minutes,
             as the spacecraft reached a maximum altitude of 240 kilometers whilst traveling at a speed of 27,400 kilometers
             an hour. This historic feat towards human-space exploration remarked Gargarin as a Soviet hero, where his scientific
             contribution towards the space race was highly honored by the Soviet Union themselves.</p>

          <h1 class="slide-in from-right">THE FIRST SPACEWALK</h1>
          <p class="slide-in from-right">The manned space mission of Voskhod-2 conducted by the Soviet Union had successfully deployed a cosmonaut
            named Alexei Leonov as the first man to execute a spacewalk upon outer space itself, interacting with the
            environment directly without being inside a spacecraft. This remarked that the Soviets had innovated a spacesuit
            which is able to effectively protect the human body from the destructive environment of outer space, which in
            itself initialized further manned missions. It was both exhilarating yet terrifying, as he spent up to 12
            minutes on the vacuums while connected to the spacecraft via a 5.4 meter tether. </p>

          <p class="slide-in from-right">Apollo-11 was a successful crewed mission which led to the first manned moon landing by astronauts Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin,
            Neil Armstrong and Michael Collins. Neil Armstrong became the first man to take the first steps within the lunar
            surface. This mission was remarked as a finishing blow which signified the triumph achieved by the United States
            within the space race. After taking 76 hours travelling over 380,000 kilometers, Armstrong famously said, “That's
            one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,” after conducting his first steps upon the lunar surface. The
            Apollo-11 mission accomplished the United States’s ambitions to land a man on the moon, as pledged by former US
            president John F. Kennedy.</p>

          <h1 class="slide-in from-right">APOLLO-SOYUZ INTERMUTUAL MISSION</h1>
          <p class="slide-in from-right">As cold war tensions between the USA and USSR decreased with the flow of time, both nations agreed to launch
            a cooperative mission where two separate flights of Apollo and Soyuz were conjoined, conducting a handshake
            between its crew captains. The mission began at Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, where spacecraft Soyuz-19
            launched on July 15, 1975, followed by the launch of an Apollo spacecraft via Saturn IB rockets. Both the
            Apollo and Soyuz spacecraft conducted an orbital motion which led into a circular, 229 kilometer orbit above
            the Earth’s lithosphere. The hard-dock between the two vehicles was achieved on July 17, 1975, where crewmembers
            of Apollo: Thomas Stafford, Vance Brand and Donald Slayton, and Soyuz: Alexey Leonov and Valery Kubasov, met
            within the vacuums of outer space.</p>
          <p class="slide-in from-right">The Soyuz-19 spacecraft ended its mission after 2 days of hard-docking with the Apollo spacecraft, as it
            landed safely within the district of Baikonur Cosmodrome. The Apollo spacecraft and its crew members stayed
            within the Earth’s orbit for up to 3 days, conducting further research on space-science and Earth-observing
            experiments. The spacecraft itself splashed down within the Hawaiian Ocean as a water-landing was executed,
            which became the last planned one for NASA human spaceflight.  This officially became the paving for future
            joint missions between the USA and USSR, including the ISS and Shutter-Mir programme.</p>

          <p class="slide-in from-right">The first space shuttle mission, STS-1, implemented the world’s first reusable spacecraft developed by NASA.
            The space shuttle would launch normally, propelled via strong ICBMs, while able to return to Earth after carrying
            large payloads during orbital missions. The reusable spacecraft consisted of two solid rocket boosters, which
            provided most of the shuttle's thrust during launch, a huge rust-colored external tank, and the orbiter, which
            contained the crew cabin. This revolutionary technology of reusable space vehicles allowed for the significant
            decrease of budgets directed towards the federal government, eminently the United States’s space agency.</p>

          <p class="slide-in from-right">Astronaut Bruce McCandless conducted the first untethered spacewalk, or also remarked as a “free” spacewalk,
            where he performed an extravehicular activity outside the STS-41B Challenger spacecraft. This spacewalk was
            notoriously known as a historical feat as no lifelines were tethering the astronaut to prevent any unwanted
            extraterrestrial accidents. McCandless managed to freely venture within the vacuums of space for up to 91
            meters away from the Challenger spacecraft, and managed to return safely with the assistance of the Manned
            Maneuvering Unit (MMU). The MMU provided motion controlled handles which implemented nitrogen thrusters to
            manually direct a spacewalk such that a propulsive force between the instrument and the outside space
            environment could be effectively controlled.</p>

            including Jupiter, Earth, Venus, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune were within the viewing angle of the vehicle
            lens. This image, which is remarked as the Family Portrait and the Portrait of the Planets, allowed for
            subtle yet impactful scientific discoveries of an authentic visualization of the solar system itself.
            The individual frames which make up the image were extracted via filtering and a Narrow-Angled camera,
            allowing for a thorough interpretation of the planets’s colorings and close-up details.</p>

            A proton rocket was used to thrust the component of the ISS, with the aid of the STS-88 space shuttle flight.
            The assembly of a new complex transported the launch of the Russian proton rocket on the Baikonur Cosmodrome
            in Kazakhstan, preparing for a manned space mission towards the orbiting ISS itself. Finally, Yuri Gargarin
            became the first man to be deployed within the ISS to usher in the era of the new space age which heavily
            relied on an orbiting compartment as directional nodes for future manned missions.</p>

          <p class="slide-in from-right">The Huygens Probe was an artificial satellite which was built to discover the second-largest moon on Saturn,
            Titan. The probe was 2.7 meters wide, weighed roughly 318 kilograms, taking 2 hours and 27 minutes to descend
            through the atmospheric medium of Titan. The artificial satellite managed to conduct a soft landing on the
            surface of Titan, implementing a heat shield as a brake and for thermal protection. Scientific instruments
            were also carried such that a rigorous analysis of the moon’s characteristics may be processed. These devices
            included the Huygens Atmospheric Structure Instrument, Doppler Wind Experiment, Spectral Radiometer,
            Gas Chromatograph Mass Spectrometer, Aerosol Collector and Pyrolyser, and Surface-Science Package.
            The mission concluded that Titan was potentially a habitable celestial body, as it possesses a dense
            atmosphere as well as lakes of liquid ethane which may support non-water based life.</p>

          <p class="slide-in from-right">Mercury, the closest planet to the sun, is considered as one of the most difficult planets to discover
            due to its proximity towards the sun. The spacecraft Messenger-1, was launched from Cape Canaveral,
            Florida, in 2004 with a primary mission to orbit Mercury and conduct scientific experiments upon its
            atmosphere and surface. The journey from Earth to Mercury is an outstanding 7.8 billion kilometers,
            taking more than six and a half years to completely achieve an orbit upon the planet of Mercury.
            On March 18, 2011, Messenger-1 fired its main engine to travel within the vicinity of Mercury’s
            atmosphere, reaching up to a distance of 205 kilometers above its surface. The spacecraft managed
            to take over 300,000 photographs and crucial data regarding the planet itself, such as surface
            temperature, atmospheric pressure, elemental composition, etc. Conclusively, the findings from
            Messenger-1 upon one of the most mysterious planets of the time was a remarkable accomplishment
            towards the space age.</p>

          <p class="slide-in from-right">The Crew Dragon spacecraft launched by a Falcon-9 rocket remained as a historic launch, as Space-X
            was the first private space flight company to conduct a manned mission to outer space. The launch site
            at Complex 39-A, Cape Canaveral, Florida, also enacted as the prominent setting for manned missions to
            the Moon and the Demo-2 mission. The Crew Dragon managed to hoist two Space-X astronauts ,Bob Behnken
            and Doug Hurley, in the orbital range of the Earth. The remarkable feat of Space-X within the aerospace
            engineering industry opens up great potential for future missions which do not rely on the federal agency
            and governmental space programs such as NASA, where instead private space companies are able to independently
            conduct manned missions to effectively allow for technological innovation within the space age. The
            destination of the Crew Dragon spacecraft was the International Space Station, where the astronauts
            spent 19 hours on the artificial structure, measuring 400 kilometers above Earth’s atmosphere. This
            mission truly demonstrated the capability of private spaceflight companies to launch, reflecting on
            humanity’s efforts to work together within the most difficult of times in the name of science.</p>
